      question: "How do I search for neighborhoods?",
      answer: "You can search for neighborhoods in several ways: Use the search bar in the header to find specific areas, browse the Explorer page to filter by criteria like budget and safety, or ask our AI Chat assistant using natural language queries like 'Find family-friendly areas under R30,000/month'."
    },
    {
      question: "What does the AI Chat assistant do?",
      answer: "Our AI Chat assistant helps you find neighborhoods using natural language. You can ask questions like 'Where should a young professional live?' or 'Show me safe areas with good restaurants.' The AI understands your preferences and provides personalized recommendations with detailed explanations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I compare neighborhoods?",
      answer: "Select neighborhoods by clicking the 'Add to Compare' button on neighborhood cards. Once you've selected 2 or more areas, click the comparison indicator in the header or visit the Compare page. You'll see side-by-side analysis of safety, housing costs, amenities, and more."
    },
    {
      question: "What do the safety scores mean?",
      answer: "Safety scores range from 1-10, with 10 being the safest. These scores are based on crime statistics, security features, and community safety measures. Scores above 7 indicate very safe areas, 5-7 are moderately safe, and below 5 may require extra caution."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the rental pricing data?",
      answer: "Our rental data is sourced from Property24, Private Property, Seeff, and PayProp market reports for 2025. Prices are updated regularly and include bedroom-specific pricing (studio to 4-bedroom). Remember that actual prices may vary based on specific property features and market conditions."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'Transit Score' mean?",
      answer: "Transit Score (0-100) measures how well-connected an area is to public transportation. Higher scores mean better access to buses, trains, and taxis. Scores above 70 indicate excellent public transport, 50-70 is good, and below 50 may require a car for convenient travel."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I save my favorite neighborhoods?",
      answer: "Currently, you can add neighborhoods to your comparison list during your session. For permanent saving and user accounts, this feature is planned for future updates. Use the comparison feature to keep track of areas you're interested in."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I interpret the demographic data?",
      answer: "Demographic data includes population size, median age, income levels, and ethnic composition. This helps you understand the community character. Median income is shown in ZAR annually, and education levels show the percentage with matric, diploma, and degree qualifications."
